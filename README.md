# XRAY-report-generator

## Project description
XRAY Report Generator is a machine learning-based tool designed to assist radiologists in generating descriptive reports from X-ray images. This project aims to reduce the time and effort required by radiologists to write detailed reports based on the XRAY scan description, thereby increasing efficiency and turnover. The generative model is trained using combinations of XRAY images and their labels (descriptions), in the same fashion as image captioning is performed. The Deep Learning (DL) model developed for this scope makes use of the attention mechanisms to improve text significance within the clinical image context. As such, the core feature of this project is generating descriptive captions for X-ray images using a state-of-the-art model. The script uses a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of X-ray images and corresponding radiology reports. When an X-ray image is input into the system, the model generates a caption that describes the key findings in the image. This caption can then be used as a starting point for writing the radiology report.

## How to use
Run the XRAYREPS.py file to launch the script and use the main menu to navigate the different options. The main menu allows selecting one of the following options:


**1) Preprocess XRAY dataset:** ...

**2) Pretrain XREP model** ...

**3) Generate reports based on images** ...

**4) Exit and close**

### Configurations
The configurations.py file allows to change the script configuration. The following parameters are available:

**Settings for training performance and monitoring options:**
- `generate_model_graph:` generate and save 2D model graph (as .png file)
- `use_mixed_precision:` whether or not to use mixed precision for faster training (mix float16/float32)
- `use_tensorboard:` activate or deactivate tensorboard logging
- `XLA_acceleration:` use of linear algebra acceleration for faster training 

**Settings for pretraining parameters:**
- `training_device:` select the training device (CPU or GPU)
- `epochs:` number of training iterations
- `learning_rate:` learning rate of the model during training
- `batch_size:` size of batches to be fed to the model during training
- `embedding_size:` embedding dimensions (valid for both models)

**Settings for data preprocessing and predictions:**
- `use_test_data:` whether or not to use test data
- `invert_test:` test data placement (True to set last points as test data)
- `data_size:` fraction of total available data to use
- `test_size:` fraction of data to leave as test data
- `window_size:` length of the input timeseries window
- `output_size:` number of next points to predict (output sequence)
- `predictions_size:` number of timeseries points to take for the predictions inputs
