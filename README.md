# XRAY-report-generation

## Project description
XRAY Caption Generator is a machine learning-based tool designed to assist radiologists in generating descriptive reports from X-ray images. This project aims to reduce the time and effort required by radiologists to write detailed reports, thereby increasing efficiency and accuracy. The generative model is trained using combinations of XRAY images and their labels (descriptions), in the same fashion as image captioning is performed. The Deep Learning (DL) model developed for this scope makes use of the attention mechanisms to improve text significance within the clinical image context.
As such, the core feature of this project is generating descriptive captions for X-ray images using a state-of-the-art model. 

## How it works
The script uses a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of X-ray images and corresponding radiology reports. When an X-ray image is input into the system, the model generates a caption that describes the key findings in the image. This caption can then be used as a starting point for writing the radiology report.
